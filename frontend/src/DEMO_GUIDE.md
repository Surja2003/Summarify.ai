## 📊 Sample Documents for Demo

### Academic Paper Sample
```
Recent advances in artificial intelligence have transformed the landscape of natural language processing. Machine learning models, particularly transformer-based architectures, have achieved unprecedented performance on various NLP tasks. This paper examines the application of BERT and GPT models to document summarization, comparing their effectiveness against traditional extractive methods. Our findings demonstrate a 23% improvement in ROUGE scores when using fine-tuned transformers compared to TF-IDF approaches. However, we also note the computational costs and potential biases inherent in large language models. The study concludes that hybrid approaches combining extractive and abstractive techniques offer the best balance of performance and efficiency.
